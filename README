Tk-Image-Cut version 0.02
=========================

 Perl extension for a graphic user interface to cut pictures.
 The module is a mixed widget from Buttons, Labels, BrowseEntry, Entrys and Canvas widgets.
 I hope the graphic user interface is simple enough to be understood without great declarations.
 It can be used as an independent application or just like how any other widget. 
 Try out the test.pl program.
 You can use all standard widget options.
